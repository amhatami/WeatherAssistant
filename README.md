##  The basic info of the Weather Assistant app:

App contains the following screens:
● Home screen:

○ Showing a list of locations that the user has bookmarked previously.
○ Show a way to remove locations from the list
○ Add locations by placing a pin on map.

● City screen: once the user clicks on a bookmarked city this screen will appear. On this
screen the user should be able to see:
○ Today’s forecast, including: temperature, humidity, rain chances and wind
information

● Help screen: The help screen should be done using a webview, and contain information
of how to use the app, gestures available if any, etc.
The following bonus points can be implemented:

● Settings page: where the user can select some preferences like: unit system
(metric/imperial), any other user setting you consider relevant, e.g. reset cities
bookmarked.

● On the city screen: show the 5-days forecast, including: temperature, humidity, rain
chances and wind information.
